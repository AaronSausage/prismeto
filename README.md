# Problem:
I work with engineers and observe how they act and deal, especially with content they have created. 
I've noticed they don't want to waste time on social media and other marketing activities to properly promote their hard work, 
even if marketing could be their best leverage both personally and professionally.

I get it. They're engineers, problem solvers ‚Äî NOT marketers.

**To address this, I'm building a simple tool -> Prismeto: content distribution for busy programmers**



## Assumptions:
Imagine a simple path: <br>
You wrote a blogpost and you wanna share it though your other social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, FB or e-mail newsletter to name a few. 
Each of those platforms may vary in terms of text length or other factors so we'd like to spread the word differently.

But we don't wanna waste our time for login to each of them and handle their UI's.

That's what I want to build here: a simple tool which you can just plug-in to your workflow to speed up and simplify your content distribution process.


## Planned features:

***My Background:***<br>
I'm more of a founder/business guy, working mostly around sales, marketing, and business strategy. 
I don't see myself as a programmer in any traditional sense, but I've always wanted to learn how to code. 
Building things and satisfying my curiosity is my number one driver.

If this helps me understand the programming world and assists other devs as well, then that's the *Ikigai* I'm here for.

This project is also my playground to learn Ruby on Rails. 
It's the framework and programming language where I hope to achieve the fastest results üòâ

I don't know how to use Git, IDEs, the command line, or any of that stuff. 
I've never coded anything before, but I'm eager to learn.


**Let's start from scratch and see where it takes us.** <br>
Feel free to contribute and comment anytime ü§ù
