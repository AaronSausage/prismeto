**Problem:**
I work with engineers and observe how they act and deal, especially with content they have created. 
I've noticed they don't want to waste time on social media and other marketing activities to properly promote their hard work, 
even if marketing could be their best leverage both personally and professionally.

I get it. They're engineers, problem solvers ‚Äî NOT marketers.

**To address this, I'm building a simple tool: content distribution for busy programmers**


My Background:
I'm more of a founder/business guy, working mostly around sales, marketing, and business strategy. 
I don't see myself as a programmer in any traditional sense, but I've always wanted to learn how to code. 
Building things and satisfying my curiosity is my number one driver.

If this helps me understand the programming world and assists other devs as well, then that's the *Ikigai* I'm here for.

This project is also my playground to learn Ruby on Rails. 
It's the framework and programming language where I hope to achieve the fastest results üòâ

I don't know how to use Git, IDEs, the command line, or any of that stuff. 
I've never coded anything before, but I'm eager to learn.


**Let's start from scratch and see where it takes us.**
