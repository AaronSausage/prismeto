# Problem:
I work with engineers and observe how they act and deal, especially with content they have created. 
I've noticed they don't want to waste time on social media and other marketing activities to properly promote their hard work, 
even if marketing could be their best leverage both personally and professionally.

I get it. They're engineers, problem solvers ‚Äî NOT marketers.

**To address this, I'm building a simple tool**

> **Prismeto: <br>‚Üí Content distribution for busy programmers <br>‚Üí Turn your technical blogpost into your marketing machine**



## Assumptions:
Imagine a simple path: <br>
You wrote a blogpost and you wanna share it though your other social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, FB or e-mail newsletter to name a few. 
Each of those platforms may vary in terms of text length or other factors so we'd like to spread the word differently.

But we don't wanna waste our time for login to each of them and handle their UI's.

That's what I want to build here: a simple tool which you can just plug-in to your workflow to speed up and simplify your content distribution process.


## Planned features:
1. Getting input data from blog and prepare version for e-mail newsletter
2. the same for different social media apps  <br> 
...tbc

## Roadmap (personal+project):
- [x] ~~Get domain prismeto.com (for marketing/sales and future app purposes)~~
- [x] ~~Prepare simple landing page~~
- [x] ~~Host prismeto.com on netlify/ghpages for auto deploys~~
- [x] ~~Choose Blog engine (never did that through github)~~ -> Hugo
- [x] ~~Create Blog (build in public & dumping thoughts)~~
- [x] ~~Create Blog on localhost~~
- [x] ~~Create additional repo for blog builds~~ -> no need, monorepo took place
- [x] ~~Separate blog builds from the content~~ -> no need, monorepo
- [ ] Start making first issues from the roadmap itself 
- [ ] Make a list of technical blogs matching the data sources
- [x] ~~Move Blog from localhost to github/netlify~~ -> build 
- [x] ~~Choose documentation engine (Docosaurus or Mintlify)~~ -> Docosaurus
- [ ] Create documentation page
- [ ] Add Cloudflare protection
- [ ] Configure MX records oc Cloudflare/Netlify for email handling
- [x] ~~Setup DNS section for migration to prismeto.com~~
- [ ] Sketch basic architecture of the app
- [ ] Learn RoR basics & practice
- [ ] Learn API basics & practice
- [ ] Learn Databases basics & practice (if needed)
- [ ] Coding first feature with input data from blog
- [ ] Matching data from input to different output sources
- [ ] Add local LLM to work
- [ ] Add OpenAI ChatGPT trough API
<br>

### Additional thoughts:
- Think about getting traffic from other 100commits competition and/or GitHub -> as future users / issues providers 
- Think about getting traffic from other sources over the internet (mainly through content distribution üòâ on different platforms where I find other devs who'd like to use this app in their workflow)
- Think about output sources (starting from e-mail newsletter as a main output source and adding other sources down below - match this point with point above, prioritise adding sources to distribute my blog posts (as I'm building in public) to earn visibility/traffic)
- Think about how to use AI (API based or local/server LLMs) in output processing <br>

***My Background:***<br>
I'm more of a founder/business guy, working mostly around sales, marketing, and business strategy. 
I don't see myself as a programmer in any traditional sense, but I've always wanted to learn how to code. 
Building things and satisfying my curiosity is my number one driver.

If this helps me understand the programming world and assists other devs as well, then that's the *Ikigai* I'm here for.

This project is also my playground to learn Ruby on Rails. 
It's the framework and programming language where I hope to achieve the fastest results üòâ

I don't know how to use Git, IDEs, the command line, or any of that stuff. 
I've never coded anything before, but I'm eager to learn.


**Let's start from scratch and see where it takes us.** <br>
Feel free to contribute and comment anytime ü§ù
